# Anomaly-detection
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected items or events in data sets, which differ from the norm. And anomaly detection is often applied on unlabeled data which is known as unsupervised anomaly detection.

Anomaly detection has two basic assumptions:


Anomalies only occur very rarely in the data.
Their features differ from the normal instances significantly.
For example, a credit card company will use anomaly detection to track how customers typically use their credit cards. If a customer makes an abnormally large purchase or a purchase in a new location, the algorithm recognizes the anomaly and alerts a team member to contact the customer.


What is the purpose of anomaly detection?
Anomaly detection is the ability to identify rare items or observations that don't conform to normal or common patterns found in data. These outliers are important within financial data because they can indicate potential risks, control failures, or business opportunities.
